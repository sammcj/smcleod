            </div>IntroAt Infoxchange we use XenServer as our Virtualisation of choice. There are many reasons for this including:
Open Source. Offers greater performance than VMware. Affordability (it&rsquo;s free unless you purchase support). Proven backend Xen is very reliable. Reliable cross-host migrations of VMs. The XenCentre client, (although having to run in a Windows VM) is quick and simple to use. Upgrades and patches have proven to be more reliable than VMware. OpenStack while interesting, is not yet reliable or streamlined enough for our small team of 4 to implement and manage.

While the P420i RAID controller in the DS2220sb is clearly saturated and unable to provide throughput much over 1,100MB/s - the IOP/s available to PostgreSQL are still a very considerably performance improvement over our P4530 SAN - in fact, 6 SSD&rsquo;s result in a 39.]]></description></item><item><title>Building a high performance SSD SAN - Part 1</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/building-a-high-performance-ssd-san-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/building-a-high-performance-ssd-san-part-1/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Those of us using technologies such as Docker and BTRFS or simply trying to gain a performance edge on the competition have a lot to gain from the features and performance of recent Kernel updates (especially from 3.18 onwards).
&lsquo;Enterprise&rsquo; Linux distributions such as RHEL &amp; variants are concerningly out of date when comes to the Kernel. Many people seem to have forgotten what Linux is&hellip; Linux IS the Kernel.
Someone said to me recently &lsquo;Why do I need a more modern Kernel? - It never gives us problems!&rsquo; later in the conversation they alluded to a number of performance issues they were experiencing with both a database platform and with some modern containerised applications they were trying to run.]]></description></item><item><title>Talk - High Performance Software Defined Storage</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/04/talk-high-performance-software-defined-storage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/04/talk-high-performance-software-defined-storage/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

One of the many lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt from my Linux HA / Storage clustering project is that the Debian HA ecosystem is essentially broken, We reached the point where packages were too old, too buggy or in Debian 8&rsquo;s case - outright missing.
In the past I was very disappointed with RHEL/CentOS 5 / 6 and (until now) have been quite satisfied with Debian as a stable server distribution with historicity more modern packages and kernels.
I feel that CentOS / RHEL 7 has changed the game.*

Reasons rcd_serial makes for a very good STONITH mechanism:
It has no dependency on power state. It has no dependency on network state. It has no dependency on node operational state. It has no dependency on external hardware. It costs less that $5 + time to build. It is incredibly simple and reliable. Essentially the most common STONITH agent type in use is probably those that control UPS / PDUs, while this sounds like a good idea in theory there are a number of issues with relying on a UPS / PDU:]]></description></item><item><title>iSCSI Benchmarking</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/07/iscsi-benchmarking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/07/iscsi-benchmarking/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>&ldquo;Having a SCSI ID is a f*cking idiotic thing to do.&rdquo;
- Linus Torvalds
&hellip;and after the amount of time I&rsquo;ve wasted getting XenServer to play nicely with LIO iSCSI failover I tend to agree.
The Problem One oddity of Xen / XenServer&rsquo;s storage subsystem is that it identifies iSCSI storage repositories via a calculated SCSI ID rather than the iSCSI Serial - which would be the sane thing to do.
Citrix&rsquo;s less than ideal take on dealing with SCSI ID changes is for you to take your VMs offline, disconnected the storage repositories, recreate them, then go through all your VMs and re-attach their orphaned disks hoping that you remembered to add some sort of hint as to what VM they belong to, then finally wipe the sweat and tears from your face.]]></description></item><item><title>Fix XenServer SR with corrupt or invalid metadata</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/01/fix-xenserver-sr-with-corrupt-or-invalid-metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/01/fix-xenserver-sr-with-corrupt-or-invalid-metadata/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>In late November of 2018 I was lucky enough to get my hands on the upcoming 2019 Sport spec Mustang GT v8 to be its first driver.
I&rsquo;m not usually an American Muscle enthusiast, but the new 2019 GT really is quite different from its slightly older counterparts, with a new specially developed 10 speed gearbox (yes, 10 gears - because more is better right?), tuned up suspension and so seemed like it would make for a pretty fun trip.
I might do a review of the car at some point, needless to say it was a lot of fun, very quick, handled surprisingly well for a big America v8, it did however suffer from very poorly designed console controls.]]></description></item><item><title>Goodbye XenSever - Hello XCP-ng</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/02/goodbye-xensever-hello-xcp-ng/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/02/goodbye-xensever-hello-xcp-ng/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>In 2018 I set out to replace our XenSever 7.2 based virtualisation after Citrix essentially screwed over free / open source users.
This project was to directly replace XenServer 7.2 with something supported and manageable for our traditional virtualisation needs.
High Level Selection ConsiderationsI evaluated a number of options, with the primary candidates below.
Key criteria (at a high level) I was evaluating:
Ease of moving from our existing XenServer 7.2 based hypervisor clusters. Security (architecture, hardening, monitoring, logging). Cost (both licensing if any and self-support / management costs). VM Performance (Storage IOPs and throughput, Network latency and throughput, Processing latency, steal from over-provisioned workloads).</description></item><item><title>Leaving Infoxchange</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

In 2012 I was hired to work with Infoxchange to &ldquo;shake things up&rdquo; (in the Systems Operations team) and stabilise the hosting environment.
As Team Lead of Systems Operations I was tasked with melding the team and then for us to work to provide a stable, robust, modern and scalable platform for Infoxchange developed application hosting and product delivery and in a short time, with a small budget - we did just that.
This 7~ year journey was exciting, rewarding and of course at times very stressful.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a cultural practice, like innovation, and it makes just as little sense hiring &ldquo;innovation engineers&rdquo; and expecting your organisation to be innovative, without also creating the culture to foster innovation.&rdquo; (Joel Shea when responding to this posted on LinkedIn)
In most cases it&rsquo;s clear the organisation doesn&rsquo;t truly know what they want or need and likely don&rsquo;t understand the nuances of the aspects of engineering.
The problem is - they&rsquo;re going to end up with a â€˜Camel Dressed As A Unicorn&rsquo; rather than someone with deep or natural engineering understanding in the areas they most need to help see, discuss, solve problems and deliver effective and lasting solutions.]]></description></item><item><title>Rest in Peace Jimothy</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2020/10/rest-in-peace-jimothy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2020/10/rest-in-peace-jimothy/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

Research1 shows there is great value in people embracing a shared vision and ideas that are bigger than themselves.
When it comes to a team charter, it&rsquo;s important to remember that it&rsquo;s not a static document. It&rsquo;s a living document that should be updated as the team evolves and grows.
Keep in mind that
One size doesn&rsquo;t fit all. Consider your (teams) mission, cultural background and values.

However in recent years Evernote has gone downhill to the point it could be considered hostile to it&rsquo;s users.
The native macOS app was replaced with an Electron Javascript webframe and like almost all Electron apps I&rsquo;ve tried it was plagued by poor performance, memory leaks and aggressive idle CPU utilisation and above all else it now lacks the low latency feeling the native application had.
With the release of the updated client, Evernote has removed offline note functionality - tough luck if you&rsquo;re travelling or don&rsquo;t have reliable internet access.]]></description></item><item><title>Firefox Addons for 2022</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2022/05/firefox-addons-for-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2022/05/firefox-addons-for-2022/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
