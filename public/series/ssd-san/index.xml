            </div>Over the coming month I will be architecting, building and testing a modular, high performance SSD-only storage solution.
I&rsquo;ll be documenting my progress / findings along the way and open sourcing all the information as a public guide.
With recent price drops and durability improvements in solid state storage now is better time than any to ditch those old magnets.
Modular server manufacturers such as SuperMicro have spent large on R&amp;D thanks to the ever growing requirements from cloud vendors that utilise their hardware.
The State Of Enterprise StorageCompanies often settle for off-the-shelf large name storage products from companies based on several, often misguided assumptions:]]></description></item></channel></rss>
