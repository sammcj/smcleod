This helps with: Sharing knowledge amongst the team. Identifying common problems that others might be having or aware of. Balances support to prevent any individual getting overloaded. Helps ensure a timely response. Allowing others to keep up to date with ongoing issues. Eases cognitive load by: Reducing the number of notifications people receive Reducing context switching. Allows people to search for previously occurring questions and answers. Highlighting documentation gaps. Making work visible.

Keep in mind that One size doesn‚Äôt fit all. Consider your (teams) mission, cultural background and values. While not exhaustive - this is on the longer side, you may wish to distill as is practical, but I implore you not to only pick the easier items - that‚Äôs missing the point.

From Wikipedia: Most of Pure Comedy was written in 2015. It touches on themes of progress, technology, fame, the environment, politics, aging, social media, human nature, human connection and his own role in it all. Tillman included an 1800-word-long essay about its symbolism and meaning in the release announcement email to his fan club. Pure Comedy is the story of a species born with a half-formed brain. The species‚Äô only hope for survival, finding itself on a cruel, unpredictable rock surrounded by other species who seem far more adept at this whole thing (and to whom they are delicious), is the reliance on other, slightly older, half-formed brains. This reliance takes on a few different names as their story unfolds, like ‚Äúlove,‚Äù ‚Äúculture,‚Äù ‚Äúfamily,‚Äù etc. Over time, and as their brains prove to be remarkably good at inventing meaning where there is none, the species becomes the purveyor of increasingly bizarre and sophisticated ironies. These ironies are designed to help cope with the species‚Äô loathsome vulnerability and to try and reconcile how disproportionate their imagination is to the monotony of their existence.

We were part way through a routine rolling pool upgrade of our hypervisor (XenServer) cluster when we observed unexpected and intermittent loss of connectivity between several VMs, then entire XenServer hosts. The problems appeared to impact hosts that hadn‚Äôt yet upgraded to XenServer 7.2. We now attribute this to a symptom of extreme packet loss between the hosts in the pool and thanks to buggy firmware from Broadcom and HP. We were aware of the recently published issues with Broadcom/HP NICs used in VMware clusters where NICs would be bricked by a firmware upgrade. This issue is different from what we experienced. We experienced extreme packet loss between hosts in the cluster. With XenServer, the pool master must be upgraded first. The result was that XAPI pool management suffered a communication breakdown across the management network and complicated diagnosis. In fact, the connectivity problems went unnoticed until many hours after the master was upgraded. At first appeared as if it was a problem caused by the pool being partially upgraded. We wondered if we had perhaps made a poor decision to run the upgrade on a single node for a few hours to observe its performance. We made the call to upgrade another host and analyse our findings. The next upgraded hosts appeared stable. In fact we later found this host wasn‚Äôt impacted by the bug. We then made the call to upgrade several more nodes and continue to track their stability. After upgrading half the pool, we suddenly hit problems. VMs failed, Hosts started dropping out of the pool and losing track of the power state of running/stopped VMs. We found that the master along with one of the other hosts were experiencing major packet loss on their management network cards. We suspected faulty NICs as it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time a Broadcom had failed us and there is no physical network cabling. Broadcom has had its fair share of bad press over the years. Many botched firmware updates and proprietary driver issues. I‚Äôm recommending people to stay clear from using network cards based on their chipsets.

We then upgraded to 2.18.44-1 / 7.14.62 again with no improvement. We even went as far as trying 2.16.20 / 7.12.83 from back in 2015 - but still no luck. At the time of writing this no firmware downgrades (or upgrades) have fixed the issue. The packet loss manifests itself immediately after rebooting or power cycling. But - not on every reboot!. This is the odd thing - approximately half the time when booting a host it is fine until the next boot. We‚Äôve compared the dmesg, lspci and modinfo output between boot cycles, we can‚Äôt find anything that stands out. The bug seems to be caused by the version of the bnx2x driver present in XenServer 7.2‚Äôs Kernel. Upon further reading HP recommends that you use bnx2x driver 7.14.29-2 or later, XenServer still uses the old Kernel version of 4.4.0 - that‚Äôs not currently an option. I suspect that it‚Äôs a bug in the Broadcom firmware loaded into the NIC upon boot. I suspect a race condition related to the devices interrupt handling (MSI/MSI-X).

I had a go at disconnecting my from the clutches of Google first by trying not to sign into any of their applications and disabling all the information reporting in settings, I felt like I was a bit like how iOS was back in the iPhone 3G days when you had to root the phone to do half the things you wanted. I then ended up flashing a custom rom that was pretty much stock, but without the good stock apps, I had to install the Google App Store and create an account which I think is fair enough because I couldn‚Äôt be bothered dropping custom downloaded apks and using that dreadful android transfer tool from my laptop which seems to work 4/5 times you plug your phone in, but like a lot of the apps in the ecosystem - felt very ‚Äòjavaish‚Äô (pun slightly intended).

A more sophisticated script is required to actually replace the non-UTF8 characters with something acceptable. Two SQL scripts are provided here, the first of these SQL scripts is: Replace_non_UTF8.underscore.sql This will replace all non-UTF8 characters with underscores. This (at least) will allow the data to be imported successfully to a UTF8 database. The second of these SQL scripts is: Replace_non_UTF8.html_equiv.sql will replace selected bytes with a UTF8-sequence which corresponds to what is rendered by Firefox when encoded as \u0026#NN; where NN is the hexadecimal value of the byte. Not all values from 80-FF are covered by this script. Please add your own translations as required. Any byte without a specific translation will be replaced with an underscore.

Reasons rcd_serial makes for a very good STONITH mechanism: It has no dependency on power state. It has no dependency on network state. It has no dependency on node operational state. It has no dependency on external hardware. It costs less that $5 + time to build. It is incredibly simple and reliable. Essentially the most common STONITH agent type in use is probably those that control UPS / PDUs, while this sounds like a good idea in theory there are a number of issues with relying on a UPS / PDU: Units that have remote power control over individual outlets are very expensive and if an upgrade is undertaken a rake-wide outage may be required depending on the existing infrastructure. Often these units are managed via the network, requiring the network and all that that entails to be functioning as expected. It also may require an additional NIC that may or may not fit into your storage units. There are almost always two PDUs / UPSs to manage, until very recently the PDU STONITH agents only supported sending an action to a single unit, while they now support sending them to two units in modern packages there a number of situations that are complex to manage and predict - i.e. what if one unit responds, cuts the power and the other doesn‚Äôt? Who‚Äôs in charge? Do we fail over? etc‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a LOT of logic for a STONITH action. I‚Äôve seen several PDUs fail, it‚Äôs not pretty and often the management interface is the first thing to go.

In the past I was very disappointed with RHEL/CentOS 5 / 6 and (until now) have been quite satisfied with Debian as a stable server distribution with historicity more modern packages and kernels. I feel that CentOS / RHEL 7 has changed the game.* (When combined with ElRepo or EPEL that provide wide array of modern packages) It is simply light years ahead of it‚Äôs predecessor, resolves a lot of the issues we‚Äôve had with Debian Jessie and after thorough testing of Debian 7,8 Centos 6,7 I have decided to employ CentOS 7 as the base OS for the storage cluster. CentOS / RHEL 7 are missing a few critical packages in the cluster HA space The available pacemaker package was built without --with-stonith. This means there is no support for legacy STONITH plugins, many of these are heavily relied upon and do not have replacements in the new plugin system. cluster-glue is missing / has been deprecated. The cluster-glue package provides a lot of very useful resource agents / plugins which again, are missing from the new pacemaker builds. crmsh is no longer available and has been replaced by pcs. pcs is great, but lots of very useful tools still use crmsh including the puppet-corosync module which is fantastic for bootstrapping clusters.

A great quote on Wikipedia under ‚Äôenterprise storage': ‚ÄúYou might think that the hardware inside a SAN is vastly superior to what can be found in your average server, but that is not the case. EMC (the market leader) and others have disclosed more than once that ‚Äúthe goal has always to been to use as much standard, commercial, off-the-shelf hardware as we can‚Äù. So your SAN array is probably nothing more than a typical Xeon server built by Quanta with a shiny bezel. A decent professional 1 TB drive costs a few hundred dollars. Place that same drive inside a SAN appliance and suddenly the price per terabyte is multiplied by at least three, sometimes even 10! When it comes to pricing and vendor lock-in you can say that storage systems are still stuck in the ‚Äúmainframe era‚Äù despite the use of cheap off-the-shelf hardware.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same old story, if you‚Äôve got lots of money and you don‚Äôt care about how you spend it or translating those savings onto your customers - sure buy the ticket, take the ride - get a unit that comes with a flash logo, a 500 page brochure, licensing requirements and a greasy sales pitch.

This leverages the performance offered by SSDs and NVM Express, by allowing much higher I/O submission rates. With this new design of the Linux kernel block layer, internal queues are split into two levels (per-CPU and hardware-submission queues), thus removing bottlenecks and allowing much higher levels of I/O parallelisation. Note the following: As of version 3.18 of the Linux kernel, released on 7 December 2014, _VirtIOblock driver and the _SCSIlayer (which is used by Serial ATA drivers) have been modified to actually use this new interface; other drivers will be ported in the following releases.

XenServer Storage \u0026 Filesystems Unfortunately the downside to XenServer is that it‚Äôs underlying OS is quite old. The latest version (6.5) about to be released is still based on Centos 5 and still lacks any form of EXT4 and BTRFS support, direct disk access is not available‚Ä¶ without some tweaking and has no real support for TRIM unless you have direct disk access and are happy with EXT3.

The udev configuration is volitile and is likely to be lost upon installing XenServer updates. You cannot (to my knowledge) boot from directly attached storage devices. What I‚Äôve actually done is partitioned the SSD RAID array into 4 paritions on the XenServer host, this allows me to carve up the SSD RAID array and present adiquit storage to several VMs on the host. i.e. ACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"sdb1\", SYMLINK+=\"xapi/block/%k\", RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c '/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\u0026'\" ACTION==\"remove\", KERNEL==\"sdb1\", RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c '/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\u0026'\" ACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"sdb2\", SYMLINK+=\"xapi/block/%k\", RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c '/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\u0026'\" ACTION==\"remove\", KERNEL==\"sdb2\", RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c '/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\u0026'\" etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve then: Mapped each partition to a VM running on that host.

With TRIM being unavailable when using RAID, it is expected that the write performance will decrease somewhat overtime as the disks fill up as the disks will have to perform a ‚ÄòREAD, ERASE, WRITE‚Äô rather than a simple WRITE, To aid the lack of TRIM, I have left more than 25% of the disks unused as we simply don‚Äôt need 1TB of SSD storage on each of the hosts. We have some 1GB cache cards arriving in the following weeks which we will upgrade to from the 512MB cards presently installed - I expect this to significantly further improve performance.
