            </div>Stop trying to hire with titles like &lsquo;DevOps Engineer&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cloud Engineer&rsquo;&ldquo;DevOps is &hellip; not a job title&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a cultural practice, like innovation, and it makes just as little sense hiring &ldquo;innovation engineers&rdquo; and expecting your organisation to be innovative, without also creating the culture to foster innovation.&rdquo; (Joel Shea when responding to this posted on LinkedIn)
In most cases it&rsquo;s clear the organisation doesn&rsquo;t truly know what they want or need and likely don&rsquo;t understand the nuances of the aspects of engineering.
The problem is - they&rsquo;re going to end up with a â€˜Camel Dressed As A Unicorn&rsquo; rather than someone with deep or natural engineering understanding in the areas they most need to help see, discuss, solve problems and deliver effective and lasting solutions.]]></description></item><item><title>Looking For New Opportunities</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/looking-for-new-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/looking-for-new-opportunities/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>As stated in my announcement post - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.
I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my &rsquo;to read&rsquo; shelf.
This is exactly what I&rsquo;ve done.
I&rsquo;m now open to new opportunitiesI&rsquo;d rather find a workplace that I can add great value too and be happy to work with than rush into a new role quickly, obviously if something great turns up right away - I&rsquo;ll pursue it.]]></description></item><item><title>Leaving Infoxchange</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>After 7~ years, I have resigned from Infoxchange.
In 2012 I was hired to work with Infoxchange to &ldquo;shake things up&rdquo; (in the Systems Operations team) and stabilise the hosting environment.
As Team Lead of Systems Operations I was tasked with melding the team and then for us to work to provide a stable, robust, modern and scalable platform for Infoxchange developed application hosting and product delivery and in a short time, with a small budget - we did just that.
This 7~ year journey was exciting, rewarding and of course at times very stressful.
I have learnt a lot and made so many very dear friends so resigning was far from easy, however it is time to move forward to new potential challenges.]]></description></item><item><title>Search - A Journey of Delivery on a Budget</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
