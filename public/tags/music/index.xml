            </div>Beginner Harmonica Practice ExercisesWay back in around 2008 I wrote up a doc with a list of beginner harp exercises and practice riffs, at the time it was uploaded to a few forums and a shared Google doc - both have since disappeared. To this day I still get regular emails asking for a copy of it so I thought I&rsquo;d copy it to a post here.
Note: I haven&rsquo;t updated these since around 2011.

            </div>Here are my top album pics for 2017 (in no particular order)
Note: This is by no means an exhaustive list, it&rsquo;s just the top albums that really stood out to me and in all fairness, I&rsquo;ve thought of several others since so there may be a follow up post (or two).
Father John Misty - Pure Comedy As a bonus, a short film was released with the album, available here.
From Wikipedia:
Most of Pure Comedy was written in 2015. It touches on themes of progress, technology, fame, the environment, politics, aging, social media, human nature, human connection and his own role in it all.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
