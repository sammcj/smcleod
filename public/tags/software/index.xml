            </div>Until recently I used Evernote for my notes, web clippings and document drafts, I was a subscriber going on 14 years and had over 3000 notes.
However in recent years Evernote has gone downhill to the point it could be considered hostile to it&rsquo;s users.
The native macOS app was replaced with an Electron Javascript webframe and like almost all Electron apps I&rsquo;ve tried it was plagued by poor performance, memory leaks and aggressive idle CPU utilisation and above all else it now lacks the low latency feeling the native application had.
With the release of the updated client, Evernote has removed offline note functionality - tough luck if you&rsquo;re travelling or don&rsquo;t have reliable internet access.]]></description></item><item><title>The Best Of - 2020 Edition</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2020/10/the-best-of-2020-edition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2020/10/the-best-of-2020-edition/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>In 2018 I set out to replace our XenSever 7.2 based virtualisation after Citrix essentially screwed over free / open source users.
This project was to directly replace XenServer 7.2 with something supported and manageable for our traditional virtualisation needs.
High Level Selection ConsiderationsI evaluated a number of options, with the primary candidates below.
Key criteria (at a high level) I was evaluating:
Ease of moving from our existing XenServer 7.2 based hypervisor clusters. Security (architecture, hardening, monitoring, logging). Cost (both licensing if any and self-support / management costs). VM Performance (Storage IOPs and throughput, Network latency and throughput, Processing latency, steal from over-provisioned workloads).</description></item><item><title>Run youtube-dl (or similar) in the background</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/07/run-youtube-dl-or-similar-in-the-background/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:52:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/07/run-youtube-dl-or-similar-in-the-background/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I wanted an alias or function to use youtube-dl in the background. Looking around the web lots of people seemed to want this and most of them were banging their heads against a wall due to:
A) bash quoting B) backgrounding dying when their terminal closed C) passing the argument (url in my case) to the function Here&rsquo;s a simple function I whipped up that seems to &lsquo;just works&rsquo;â„¢:
function yt { nohup youtube-dl &#34;$1&#34; --no-progress 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; youtube-dl-&#34;$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)&#34;.log &amp; } And if you don&rsquo;t want logs, simply send the output to /dev/null:

Navigate to about:config (in Firefox&rsquo;s URL bar) Change the value of the following two properties to 0: mousewheel.with_control.action mousewheel.with_meta.action If you use Firefox sync and want these settings to sync between your machines, also add the following properties:
Create two new properties both of type boolean and set them to true:

            </div>We&rsquo;re in the process of shifting from using our custom &lsquo;glue&rsquo; for orchestrating Docker deployments to Kubernetes, When we first deployed Docker to replace LXC and our legacy Puppet-heavy application configuration and deployment systems there really wasn&rsquo;t any existing tool to manage this, thus we rolled our own, mainly a few Ruby scripts combined with a Puppet / Hiera / Mcollective driven workflow.
The main objective is to replace our legacy NFS file servers used to host uploads / attachments and static files for our web applications, while NFS(v4) performance is adequate, it is a clear single point of failure and of course, there are the age old stale mount problems should network interruptions occur.]]></description></item><item><title>Return Of The RSS</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2017/09/return-of-the-rss/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2017/09/return-of-the-rss/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Of all the tools for reading news and subscribing to software releases, I still find RSS the most useful.
I use Feedly to manage my rss subscriptions and keep all my devices in sync, but instead of using the Feedly&rsquo;s own client, I use an app called Reeder as the client / reader itself.
Link: My Feedly RSS Feed FeedlyRSS feed subscription management
Features:
Keyword alerts. Browser plugins to subscribe to (current) url. Notation and highlighting support (a bit like Evernote). Search and filtering across large numbers of feeds / content. IFTTT, Zapier, Buffer and Hootsuite integration. Built in save / share functionality (that I only use when I&rsquo;m on the website).]]></description></item><item><title>Monitoring SystemD Units With Nagios</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/05/monitoring-systemd-units-with-nagios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/05/monitoring-systemd-units-with-nagios/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Want to know if a service or process fails without explicitly monitoring every service on a host?
&hellip;Then why not use SystemD&rsquo;s existing knowledge of all the enabled services? Thanks to &lsquo;Kbyte&rsquo; who made a simple Nagios plugin to do just this!
