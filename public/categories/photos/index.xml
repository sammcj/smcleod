            </div>In late November of 2018 I was lucky enough to get my hands on the upcoming 2019 Sport spec Mustang GT v8 to be its first driver.
I&rsquo;m not usually an American Muscle enthusiast, but the new 2019 GT really is quite different from its slightly older counterparts, with a new specially developed 10 speed gearbox (yes, 10 gears - because more is better right?), tuned up suspension and so seemed like it would make for a pretty fun trip.
I might do a review of the car at some point, needless to say it was a lot of fun, very quick, handled surprisingly well for a big America v8, it did however suffer from very poorly designed console controls.]]></description></item><item><title>Highlands Festival of Speed 2018</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/04/highlands-festival-of-speed-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/04/highlands-festival-of-speed-2018/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Last weekend I headed to New Zealand and marshalled at the Highlands Festival of Speed.
The Highlands Festival of Speed is a weekend packed with some of the best modern classic racing you will see in New Zealand. Featuring the Pre 65 Racing, Mainland Muscle, Formula Libre, South Island Porsche, OSCA, Highlands Modern Classics/Nostalgic Classics and the Highlands Sprint Series. This is a weekend of true blue Kiwi racing starring some of New Zealand&rsquo;s most well known racing legends.
