            </div>Avoid sending DMs/PMs for support and technical questionsThis is a blurb I usually add to the wiki pages of teams I work with, it&rsquo;s a simple reminder that we should avoid sending direct messages (or worse - calling) individuals for support and technical questions.
Instead, we should use the appropriate channels for the team. This is a simple way to make work visible, share knowledge, reduce context switching, avoid silos and share the support load
Avoid sending DMs/PMs for support and technical questions We value making work visiblePart of this is achieved by us making an effort to ensure we&rsquo;re asking for support and technical questions by starting a thread in our squads (or the relevant) room - instead of via of direct messaging (or calling) an individual.]]></description></item><item><title>The Best Of - 2022 Edition</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2022/10/the-best-of-2022-edition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2022/10/the-best-of-2022-edition/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>As stated in my announcement post - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.
I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my &rsquo;to read&rsquo; shelf.
This is exactly what I&rsquo;ve done.
I&rsquo;m now open to new opportunitiesI&rsquo;d rather find a workplace that I can add great value too and be happy to work with than rush into a new role quickly, obviously if something great turns up right away - I&rsquo;ll pursue it.]]></description></item><item><title>Leaving Infoxchange</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>After 7~ years, I have resigned from Infoxchange.
In 2012 I was hired to work with Infoxchange to &ldquo;shake things up&rdquo; (in the Systems Operations team) and stabilise the hosting environment.
As Team Lead of Systems Operations I was tasked with melding the team and then for us to work to provide a stable, robust, modern and scalable platform for Infoxchange developed application hosting and product delivery and in a short time, with a small budget - we did just that.
This 7~ year journey was exciting, rewarding and of course at times very stressful.
I have learnt a lot and made so many very dear friends so resigning was far from easy, however it is time to move forward to new potential challenges.]]></description></item><item><title>Goodbye XenSever - Hello XCP-ng</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/02/goodbye-xensever-hello-xcp-ng/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/02/goodbye-xensever-hello-xcp-ng/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>In 2018 I set out to replace our XenSever 7.2 based virtualisation after Citrix essentially screwed over free / open source users.
This project was to directly replace XenServer 7.2 with something supported and manageable for our traditional virtualisation needs.
High Level Selection ConsiderationsI evaluated a number of options, with the primary candidates below.
Key criteria (at a high level) I was evaluating:
Ease of moving from our existing XenServer 7.2 based hypervisor clusters. Security (architecture, hardening, monitoring, logging). Cost (both licensing if any and self-support / management costs). VM Performance (Storage IOPs and throughput, Network latency and throughput, Processing latency, steal from over-provisioned workloads).</description></item><item><title>Run youtube-dl (or similar) in the background</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/07/run-youtube-dl-or-similar-in-the-background/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:52:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/07/run-youtube-dl-or-similar-in-the-background/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I wanted an alias or function to use youtube-dl in the background. Looking around the web lots of people seemed to want this and most of them were banging their heads against a wall due to:

            </div>It was almost 3 years ago that my open source storage project went into production. In that time it&rsquo;s been running 24/7 serving as highly available solid state storage for hundreds of VMs and several virtualisation clusters across our two main sites.
I&rsquo;m happy to report that the clusters have been operating very successfully since their conception.
Since moving away from proprietary &lsquo;black box&rsquo; vendor SANs, we haven&rsquo;t had a single SAN issue, storage outage.
We&rsquo;ve also been so please with the success of the design that we&rsquo;ve grown from a single cluster at each site to a total of 6 clusters (12 nodes).]]></description></item><item><title>Theory of constraints</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/01/theory-of-constraints/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/01/theory-of-constraints/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless because it will always remain starved waiting for work from the bottleneck.
Any improvement made before the bottleneck merely results in more â€˜work&rsquo; piling up at the bottleneck.
Identify the system&rsquo;s constraint(s) (that which prevents the organisation from obtaining more of the goal in a unit of time) Decide how to exploit the system&rsquo;s constraint(s) (how to get the most out of the constraint) Subordinate everything else to the above decision (align the whole system or organization to support the decision made above) Elevate the system&rsquo;s constraint(s) (make other major changes needed to increase the constraint&rsquo;s capacity) Warning!]]></description></item></channel></rss>
