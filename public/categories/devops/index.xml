            </div>A template team charter for software and platform engineering teams.
Research1 shows there is great value in people embracing a shared vision and ideas that are bigger than themselves.
When it comes to a team charter, it&rsquo;s important to remember that it&rsquo;s not a static document. It&rsquo;s a living document that should be updated as the team evolves and grows.
Keep in mind that
One size doesn&rsquo;t fit all. Consider your (teams) mission, cultural background and values. While not exhaustive - this is on the longer side, you may wish to distill as is practical, but I implore you not to only pick the easier items - that&rsquo;s missing the point.]]></description></item><item><title>Camels Dressed As Unicorns</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/camels-dressed-as-unicorns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 08:10:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/camels-dressed-as-unicorns/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Stop trying to hire with titles like &lsquo;DevOps Engineer&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cloud Engineer&rsquo;&ldquo;DevOps is &hellip; not a job title&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a cultural practice, like innovation, and it makes just as little sense hiring &ldquo;innovation engineers&rdquo; and expecting your organisation to be innovative, without also creating the culture to foster innovation.&rdquo; (Joel Shea when responding to this posted on LinkedIn)
In most cases it&rsquo;s clear the organisation doesn&rsquo;t truly know what they want or need and likely don&rsquo;t understand the nuances of the aspects of engineering.
The problem is - they&rsquo;re going to end up with a â€˜Camel Dressed As A Unicorn&rsquo; rather than someone with deep or natural engineering understanding in the areas they most need to help see, discuss, solve problems and deliver effective and lasting solutions.]]></description></item><item><title>Talk - 24 Months</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/talk-24-months/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Sam McLeod</name></author><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/talk-24-months/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
