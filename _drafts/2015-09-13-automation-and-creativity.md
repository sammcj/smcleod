## Automation and Creativity

If the work you’re doing does not require you to be _uniquely creative_ - you can, and _will_ be automated.

Work that is not _uniqely creative_ is often work that:

- Can be easily described.
- Is process driven.

What do I mean by work that 'can be easily described'?

If I look at a piece of work and I can easily describe what takes place to complete, it then by nature must be somewhat easy to describe.

Let me give you a non-technical example:

> John listens to what people in a team are working on this week and how long they've been working these things so far and how long they think it will take to complete, he then updates this information in a project spreadsheet that contains an overview of the progress of all the project for the organisation.

Surely what people are working on and time / effort related information could easily be obtained from the systems / tools they're working with, perhaps when people are committing code for the project their [time is recorded in the commit message](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineTimeTracking#Logging-time-via-commit-messages "Logging time via commit messages in Redmine")?

### Terminology:

- Job / role / position
- what is 'work' ?
- 'easy' jobs
- jobs suited to a machine
- jobs suited to a human
- creativity - something that humans are good at

### Message:

- Easy to describe jobs are the targets for automation.
- The solution isn't to get rid of jobs for those people, but to elevate them to different positions better suited to humans.
- Use humans for creativity, architecture.
- Rethink what work is.

### Example:

- Example of these jobs, maybe parts of PM or desktop technician.
- Think about roles that used manually managed software such as ms project, installing software or even visio.
- Flowchart of a job that could / should be automated - perhaps a diagram of a actions performed by people involved in a project?
- Any time someone enters data into a spreadsheet.

### Statements:

- It used to be that a candidate for automation could be 'any repeatable task', I believe this is now 'any task that doesn't truly require creativity'.
- The only thing keeping 'those' jobs alive is poor management(?).
-  ‘If the work you’re doing does not require you to be /uniquely creative/ - you can, and /will/ be automated’

### Questions?

- What is an interface and how does it relate to this?
- What to do with all these people that are performing work that should / will be automated? (Educate them to be creative)

### Challenges:

- Measure success of automation.
- Social change and emotional responses.
