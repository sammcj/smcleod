## Automation and Creativity




### Terminology:

- Job / role / position
- what is 'work' ?
- 'easy' jobs
- jobs suited to a machine
- jobs suited to a human
- creativity - something that humans are good at

### Message:

- Easy to describe jobs are the targets for automation.
- The solution isn't to get rid of jobs for those people, but to elevate them to different positions better suited to humans.
- Use humans for creativity, architecture.
- Rethink what work is.

### Example:

- Example of these jobs, maybe parts of PM or desktop technician.
- Think about roles that used manually managed software such as ms project, installing software or even visio.
- Flowchart of a job that could / should be automated - perhaps a diagram of a actions performed by people involved in a project?
- Any time someone enters data into a spreadsheet.

### Statements:

- It used to be that a candidate for automation could be 'any repeatable task', I believe this is now 'any task that doesn't truly require creativity'.
- The only thing keeping 'those' jobs alive is poor management(?).
-  ‘If the work you’re doing does not require you to be /uniquely creative/ - you can, and /will/ be automated’

### Questions?

- What is an interface and how does it relate to this?
- What to do with all these people that are performing work that should / will be automated? (Educate them to be creative)

### Challenges:

- Measure success of automation.
- Social change and emotional responses.
