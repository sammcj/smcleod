# Writing Style Guidelines for PR Reviews

## Australian English - CRITICAL

**ALWAYS use Australian English spelling and grammar.**

### Key Spelling Patterns
- Use `-our` not `-or` (colour, favour, behaviour, honour)
- Use `-ise` not `-ize` (organise, analyse, optimise, realise)
- Use `-re` not `-er` (centre, metre, theatre)
- Use `-ogue` not `-og` (catalogue, dialogue, analogue)
- Use `-ll-` not `-l-` (travelled, modelling, cancelled)
- Use `-t` not `-ed` for past tense (learnt, dreamt, spelt)
- Use `-ence` not `-ense` for nouns (defence, licence, offence)

### Common Australian vs American Differences
- program → programme (except in computing contexts)
- airplane → aeroplane
- fall (season) → autumn
- elevator → lift
- trunk (car) → boot
- mom → mum

## Avoid AI Clichés

Never suggest or accept these overused phrases:
- comprehensive, robust, delve, showcase
- elevate, streamline, enhance, leverage, utilise, facilitate
- optimise (in marketing context), seamless
- cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changing
- best-in-class, feature-rich, production-ready, enterprise-grade

## Natural Writing Style

- Write as a knowledgeable person explaining to a colleague
- Be direct and specific, not vague and grandiose
- Use active voice and concrete examples
- If a sentence adds no value, suggest removing it
- Avoid excessive bullet points with bolded headers
- No unnecessary summary paragraphs
- No marketing or overly enthusiastic or 'fluffy' language
