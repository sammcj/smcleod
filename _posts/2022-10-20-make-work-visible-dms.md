### Avoid sending DMs/PMs for support and technical questions

This is a blurb I usually add to the wiki pages of teams I work with, it's a simple reminder that we should avoid sending direct messages for support and technical questions.

Instead, we should use the appropriate channels for the team. This is a simple way to make work visible, share knowledge, avoid silos and share the support load.

> We value making work visible.
>
> Part of this is achieved by us making an effort to ensure we're asking for support and technical questions by starting a thread in our squads (or the relevant) room - instead of via of direct messaging an individual.
>
> This helps with:
>
> * Sharing knowledge amongst the team.
> * Identifying common problems that others might be having.
> * Balances support to prevent any individual getting overloaded.
> * Helps ensure a timely response.
> * Allowing others to keep up to date with ongoing issues.
> * Reduces the number of notifications people receive and thus - > cognitive load.
> * Allows people to search for previously occurring questions and > answers.
> * Making work visible.
