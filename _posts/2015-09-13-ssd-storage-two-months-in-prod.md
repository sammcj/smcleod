## SSD Storage - Two Months In Production

Over the last two months I've been runing selected IO intensive servers off the the SSD storage cluster, these hosts include (among others) our:

- Primary Puppetmaster
- Gitlab server
- Redmine app and database servers
- Nagios servers
- Several Docker database host servers

### Reliability

We haven't had any software or hardware failures since commissioning the storage units.

During this time we have had 3 disk failures on our HP StoreVirtual SANs that have required us to call the supporting vendor and replace failed disks.

We have performed a great deal of live cluster failovers without any noticable interruption to services and with no unexpected results.

### Expected findings

#### Significately higher disk and CPU throughput when required

#### IOWait on VMs greatly reduced

#### VM IO latency has been reduced 300-500%

#### Increased reliability of performance data

Previously many hosts that we were monitoring load related statistics on previous had broken [PNP4Nagios](https://docs.pnp4nagios.org/pnp-0.6/start) graphs as they were so starved for disk IO that checks would time out or fail to reliabliy return performance information, this has been resolved on the new storage.

### Unexpected findings


#### Decreased network latency

On hosts we've moved to the new storage we've noticed a significate decrease in ping latency to these hosts. I haven't investigated this but it's not something I was expecting to see.


#### Increased SSH / login performance

I didn't think this would be very noticable but it's become blatantly obvious when you're sshing into a server running on the new storage. While this is a 'nice to have' from an admin perspective - it makes a huge difference to remote automation such as puppet runs etc... This likely a combination of the time it takes to write the logs and the decreased network latency mentioned above.
