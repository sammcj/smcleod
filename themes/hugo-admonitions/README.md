### Hugo Module

1. Install [Go programming language](https://go.dev/doc/install) in your operating system.

2. Initialize your own hugo module

```shell
hugo mod init YOUR_OWN_GIT_REPOSITORY
```

3. Add `hugo-admonitions` in your site's configuration file.

With `hugo.yaml`:

```yaml
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions
    - path: my-theme
```

With `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions"
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "my-theme"
```

4. Finally update by running:

```shell
hugo mod get -u
```

### Git Clone

1. Inside the folder of your Hugo site, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions.git themes/hugo-admonitions --depth=1
```

2. Add `hugo-admonitions` as the left-most element of the theme list variable in your site's or theme's configuration file `hugo.yaml` or `hugo.toml`.

    Example, with `hugo.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    theme: ["hugo-admonitions", "my-theme"]
    ```

    or, with `hugo.toml`,

    ```toml
    theme = ["hugo-admonitions", "my-theme"]
    ```

## Usage

> See [callout-demo.md](./callout-demo.md) for complete callout usage examples

> System notification: Your password will expire in 30 days.
```

> [!SUCCESS] Congratulations! Your code has been successfully deployed to production

> [!WARNING] Warning: This operation will delete all data. 
```

## Customization

Override styles by copying the [source](./assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss) into `assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss` and changing as needed.

If you are still confused, see the detailed process below:

1. **Create the Directory Structure**
   - In your Hugo project's root directory, create the following folder structure:
   ```
   your-hugo-project/
   ├── assets/
   │   └── sass/
   │       └── vendors/
   ```

    This can be done by running:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p assets/sass/vendors
    ```

2. **Copy the Source File**
   - Copy the original `_admonitions.scss` file, which is located in `themes/hugo-admonitions/assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss` 
   - Paste it into your project at: `assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss`
   - This will override the module's default styles
  
   This can be done by running:
   ```shell
   cp themes/hugo-admonitions/assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss assets/sass/vendors/_admonitions.scss
   ```

3. **Customize the Styles**
   - Modify the SCSS code according to your needs
   - Your changes will take precedence over the original module styles
