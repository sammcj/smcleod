A collection of quotes and musings collected over time that are important to me.

## Quotes

> "There is no 'us' and 'them'; it's an illusion.  We are all human beings, and we all have a responsibility to support one another and to discover ways of wresting the power from the very, very few people who control all the cash and all the property."

> "Everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon."

> "Long you live and high you fly. And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry. And all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be."

> "...Do you want a voice? If you do, you better bloody well go out and get it because it's not going to be handed to you on a plate."

\- Roger Waters


---

> "You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish.  I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be.  It's their mistake, not my failing."

> "Most rules lie, yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive than the chosen, cultivated ignorance that Chevallier addresses here.  This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.  It is an error to think of such war leaders or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.  They are abject.  This is what we have to learn and to act upon.  They are abject."

\- Gabriel Chevallier, Fear; A Novel of World War I (Quote from Roger Waters The Wall, 2015)

> "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!"

> "No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the ride…and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well… maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten."

> "So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"

> "Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously."

## Musings

> "Aiming to move from engineering to management is odd, think of it like a comedian - when you get good, or great even - you don't become a teacher of comedy, you tell jokes in the good or great way, you don't 'upgrade to comedian management'."

> "You call engineers resources and I'll call you overhead. What's yet - they can prove it if they work together."

> "Art isn't without its faults, some of them grave. To disregard art because of the errors of its creator or content - no matter how flawed, unjust or solipsistic, is at least - to rob the world of context. The choice to make better the future is within the power of those that experience and choose to learn and grow from it"

> "An ass, regardless how smart, still speaks through wind and vibrations."

> "A manager once said to me _"I don't come to work to make friends"_ - from point time onwards, I knew I wanted to do the exact opposite - I come to work to make friends, because the connections we make are what makes us human, they create and shape societies and give us meaning, direction and value to life."

> "It’s like we have all the time in the world for people who let the organisation down, but none of the time for the people let down by the organisation."
