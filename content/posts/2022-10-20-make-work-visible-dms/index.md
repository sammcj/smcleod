### Avoid sending DMs/PMs for support and technical questions

This is a blurb I usually add to the wiki pages of teams I work with, it's a simple reminder that we should avoid sending direct messages (or worse - calling) individuals for support and technical questions.

Instead, we should use the appropriate channels for the team. This is a simple way to make work visible, share knowledge, reduce context switching, avoid silos and share the support load

> ### We value making work visible
>
> Part of this is achieved by us making an effort to ensure we're asking for support and technical questions by starting a thread in our squads (or the relevant) room - instead of via of direct messaging (or calling) an individual.
>
> This helps with:
>
> - Sharing knowledge amongst the team.
> - Identifying common problems that others might be having or aware of.
> - Balances support to prevent any individual getting overloaded.
> - Helps ensure a timely response.
> - Allowing others to keep up to date with ongoing issues.
> - Eases cognitive load by:
>   - Reducing the number of notifications people receive
>   - Reducing context switching.
> - Allows people to search for previously occurring questions and answers.
> - Highlighting documentation gaps.
> - Making work visible.
