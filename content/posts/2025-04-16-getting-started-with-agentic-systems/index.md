As agentic systems become increasingly central to modern software development, many engineers are looking to build practical skills but don't know where to start.

This guide provides a short list of pre-reading/watching and hands-on training resources to help you get started with developing with AI agents. The focus is on practical implementation for tools and methods you're likely to use in the workplace, so you can quickly gain experience and confidence in building AI powered and agentic systems.

## Practical Tips for Getting Started

> [!TIP] The most effective way to learn is by doing.

1. **Start small**: Begin with simple agent implementations before moving to complex multi-agent systems.
2. **Focus on understanding**: Don't just copy codeâ€”understand why agents make certain decisions and how they process information.
3. **Get your hands dirty and experiment**: Create small, disposable proof-of-concept projects to test different agent architectures and approaches.
4. **Try agentic coding**: Try using tools like Cline or Copilot Agent to help accelerate your coding process.

Start with the fundamentals, work through the tutorials, and gradually take on more complex projects. The goal is not just to understand the theory but to develop practical skills that you can apply in real-world software development.
