title: Speeding Up rsync
---

The most common way to use rsync is probably as such:

```shell
rsync -avr user@<source>:<source_dir> <dest_dir>
```

Resulting in 30-35MB/s depending on file sizes

This can be improved by using a more efficient, less secure encryption algorithm, disabling compression
and telling the SSH client to disable some unneeded features that slow things down.

With the settings below I have achieved 100MB/s (at work between VMs) and over 300MB/s at home between SSD drives.

## Requirements

- Python3 (For RHEL/CentOS 7 `yum install python34`)
- python-nagiosplugin [My pre-built RPMs](https://packagecloud.io/app/s_mcleod/centos7/search?q=python-nagiosplugin) or `pip3 install nagiosplugin`
- [PyNagSystemD](https://github.com/kbytesys/pynagsystemd/blob/master/bin/pynagsystemd.py)

```shell
rsync -arv --numeric-ids --progress -e "ssh -T -c aes256-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x" user@<source>:<source_dir> <dest_dir>
```

If you want to delete files at the DST that have been deleted at the SRC (obviously use with caution:

```shell
rsync -arv --numeric-ids --progress -e "ssh -T -c aes256-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x" user@<source>:<source_dir> <dest_dir> --delete
```

## Notes

1. Because of the weak encryption used, it is not recommended for transferring files across hostile networks (such as the internet).
2. There are scenarios where enabling compression _can_ improve performance, i.e. if your network link is very slow and your files compress well.
3. Don't forget to forward your SSH keys to the host you're going to run it on! (`ssh-agent && ssh-add` ((if it's not already running)) `ssh -A user@host`)
4. If `aes256-gcm@openssh.com` isn't available for you due to using an old operating system, you can use `aes128-ctr`
