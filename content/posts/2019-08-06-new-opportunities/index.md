title: Looking For New Opportunities
---

As stated in [my announcement post](https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/06/29/leaving-infoxchange.html) - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.

I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven't spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my 'to read' shelf.

This is exactly what I've done.

## I'm now open to new opportunities

I'd rather find a workplace that I can add great value too and be happy to work with than rush into a new role quickly, obviously if something great turns up right away - I'll pursue it.

### Considerations

- What _value_ will I bring to the organisation?
- What _gaps_ or _new ventures_ is the organisation looking to hire for?
- What might I _learn_ while working?
- What is the _team structure_ I'd be joining (if any)?
- What _technologies_ will I likely be working with?
- What _tooling_ will I be required to use?
- Will I have _fun_ (at least some of the time)?
- Will I have a reasonable amount of _creative freedom_ in my work?
- How much _bureaucracy_ will surround the role I'm in?

### My Resume / CV

These days I'm generally using [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) as a living Resume / CV.

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) is also the best place to contact me regarding potential positions.

### A message to recruiters

As soon as I changed my status to 'Open to new job opportunities.' I've been swamped with messages on LinkedIn and email.

If you have a potential role for me, I've come up with a basic list of things I'd like to know before having a formal chat.

It would be greatly helpful (for both of us) if you could please send through some information about the position including:

- Role(s) and Responsibilities.
- Team size.
- _Internal_ team and company values.
- Example of what a day / week or month might look like in the position (might be hard I know).
- 'Must have' experience.
- 'Highly desired' experience.
- 'Nice to have' experience.
- Salary range.
- Office location and parking (e.g. CBD - no parking but close to major train station, Inner-suburb - Company car parking, Outer-suburb - on street parking).

If you can't answer some of those, no problem - I'm just working on this as an initial template to get a handle on the offers coming through.

#### Clarification on some common role titles and experience terms

Please see my blog post - ['Stop trying to hire with titles like â€˜DevOps Engineer' or Cloud Engineer'](https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/08/08/camels-and-unicorns.html)

- On 'DevOps' in a title:

Often when I see this, the organisation is really wanting / asking for a Senior Developer with some minor Operations experience - if so - that's not me.

I've worked very closely with Developers and Testers over the years, but I am skilled in platform and pipeline engineering, automation, highly-available
service engineering, distributed systems engineering, platform and service performance engineering and operations team leadership.

- On term 'Cloud Experience':

Cloud, for me at least - means outsourced Infrastructure and Service / Service Endpoints.

I've spent many years building private clouds, (mostly based on Xen Cloud Platform, XenServer Cloud, XCP-ng and KVM systems)
and building out reliable, cloud-native, scalable and highly redundant services that are presented and endpoints to developers, testers or businesses directly -
essentially I've been 'building private Clouds' more than I have been using 'off-the-shelf' solutions like AWS or GCP.

However, I have dipped my toes in each and completed some AWS training, at the end of the day I found that it's just a change of tooling and for me -
that's not a problem.

However if you're looking for someone that's only worked on AWS and knows all the AWS offerings inside-and-out already -
that's not me, I can or will be that person - but haven't had the need to pivot as of yet.

## What I've been upto (since Infoxchange)

- Took a 10 day holiday in Fiji, lying on the beaches, reading, decompressing and enjoying the sunshine and chatting with the locals.
- A lot of reading and research (Pitch Anything, Getting to Yes, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind).
- Skimmed through several AWS Practitioner and Best Practise Architecture guides (As mentioned, I've always designed and run cloud platforms - but not made heavy use other 'off the shelf' options).
- Completed the Amazon AWS Practitioner Essentials training.
- Caught up with fellow platform, automation engineers as well as people I see as mentors.
- Visited a few meetups.
