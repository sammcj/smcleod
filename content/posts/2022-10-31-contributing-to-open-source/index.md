Contributing to Open Source is important to the quality and maintainability of the software and engineering communities we rely on every day.

---

Often I come across peers who may have been in tech for several or more years - but don't contribute to Open Source projects.

Their Github/GitLab accounts are completely bare with no activity, their own projects are all private and they tend not to log issues for problems they encounter.

---

By 'contributing' I mean:

- Submitting bug reports / creating issues.
- Commenting on other peoples bug reports / issues.
- Updating or creating documentation.
- Submitting pull/merge requests with fixes/features.

---

It helps non-profits and small businesses get a leg up, you can positively impact the health (stress levels, context switching etc...) of existing maintainers, and of course it's good for yourself - You get to learn new technical and social skills, and importantly - build meaningful experience that you can speak to with clients and in interviews (on either side of the table).

Contributing doesn't mean you have to understand the code base and submit code fixes - it can be as simple as making sure you log bugs/issues publicly, making your work visible and updating incorrect or missing documentation.

---

Asking several people as to why - I've heard that the main reasons they don't contribute basically boil down to:

- They don't think they can add value.
- They didn't realise there was value to other people in submitting a bug report / issues for their problems.
- They are worried they might look silly.
- They don't know how to interact (socially) with a given open source community.

Here is a great resource you can share on getting started contributing to open source that addresses these concerns: <https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>
