title: SSD Storage - Two Months In Production
---

Over the last two months I've been running selected IO intensive servers off the the SSD storage cluster, these hosts include (among others) our:

- Primary Puppetmaster
- Gitlab server
- Redmine app and database servers
- Nagios servers
- Several Docker database host servers

### Reliability

We haven't had any software or hardware failures since commissioning the storage units.

During this time we have had 3 disk failures on our HP StoreVirtual SANs that have required us to call the supporting vendor and replace failed disks.

We have performed a great deal of live cluster failovers without any noticeable interruption to services and with no unexpected results.

### Expected findings

#### Significantly higher disk and CPU throughput when required

#### IOWait on VMs greatly reduced

#### VM IO latency has been reduced 300-500%

Before:

```shell
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=1 time=1.6 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=2 time=4.7 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=3 time=3.7 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=4 time=4.7 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=5 time=4.8 ms
```

After:

```shell
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=1 time=0.5 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=2 time=0.7 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=3 time=0.9 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=4 time=0.7 ms
4096 bytes from . (ext4 /dev/mapper/debian-root): request=5 time=0.6 ms
```

#### Increased reliability of performance data

Previously many hosts that we were monitoring load related statistics on previous had broken [PNP4Nagios](https://docs.pnp4nagios.org/pnp-0.6/start) graphs as they were so starved for disk IO that checks would time out or fail to reliably return performance information, this has been resolved on the new storage.

### Unexpected findings

#### Decreased network latency

On hosts we've moved to the new storage we've noticed a significant decrease in ping latency to these hosts. I haven't investigated this but it's not something I was expecting to see.

#### Increased SSH / login performance

I didn't think this would be very noticeable but it's become blatantly obvious when you're sshing into a server running on the new storage. While this is a 'nice to have' from an admin perspective - it makes a huge difference to remote automation such as puppet runs etc... This likely a combination of the time it takes to write the logs and the decreased network latency mentioned above.
