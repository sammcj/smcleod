### "A chain is no stronger than its weakest link"

- Any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion.

- Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless because it will always remain starved waiting for work from the bottleneck.

- Any improvement made before the bottleneck merely results in more â€˜work' piling up at the bottleneck.

1. _Identify_ the system's constraint(s) (that which prevents the organisation from obtaining more of the goal in a unit of time)
2. Decide how to _exploit_ the system's constraint(s) (how to get the most out of the constraint)
3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision (_align_ the whole system or organization to support the decision made above)
4. _Elevate_ the system's constraint(s) (make other major changes needed to increase the constraint's capacity)
5. Warning! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system's constraint.
