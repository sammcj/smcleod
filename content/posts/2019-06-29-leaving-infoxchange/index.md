title: Leaving Infoxchange
---

After 7~ years, I have resigned from Infoxchange.

---

In 2012 I was hired to work with [Infoxchange](https://www.infoxchange.org) to _"shake things up"_ (in the Systems Operations team) and stabilise the hosting environment.

As Team Lead of Systems Operations I was tasked with melding the team and then for us to work to provide a stable, robust, modern and scalable platform
for Infoxchange developed application hosting and product delivery and in a short time, with a small budget - we did just that.

This 7~ year journey was exciting, rewarding and of course at times very stressful.

I have learnt a lot and made so many very dear friends so resigning was far from easy, however it is time to move forward to new potential challenges.

I would like to give a particularly special thanks to:

- Ross Williamson, my friend of many years and nothing short of a truly amazing engineer.
- Alex Izmayov, for his tireless dedication and passion to learning and delivering engineering automation.
- The many fantastic developers that designed, wrote and delivered the code for many of the applications we ran.
- Many of the application consultants and product owners that care deeply for the clients we served.

## What next?

- A holiday, one where I plan to spend part of my time studying, learning and dipping my toes in any relevant technologies
I haven't been required to work with.
- A _lot_ of reading ([see the tech and personal growth items within my Goodreads 'Want to Read' shelf for a taste](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5836466-sam?order=d&shelf=to-read&sort=date_added)).
- AWS or GCP Operations guides / courses. I've always designed and run cloud platforms - but not really used other 'out of the box' options.
- A return to more frequently visiting and engaging at meetups (Infracoders, DevOps Melbourne, Elastic Meetup).
- Consultation with fellow platform, automation engineers and mentors.

## Initial considerations for future endeavours

- Will I have _fun_ (at least some of the time)?
- Will I have a reasonable amount of _creative freedom_ in my work?
- How much _bureaucracy_ will surround the role I'm in?
- What might I _learn_ while working?
- What is the _team structure_ I'd be joining (if any)?
- What _technologies_ will I likely be working with?
- What _tooling_ will I be required to use?
- Am I likely to make _friends_ in the position?

## A message to recruiters

**Note: I am now [looking for new opportunities](https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/08/06/new-opportunities.html)**

You play an important part in both leading people to new positions while helping organisations find the right people to help them stabilise or grow.

However, until I either post that I'm actively seeking a new role or set my LinkedIn to being open to new positions -
I first need time for a break and to do some reading, study and reflection.

I'll update my profiles when I'm ready to start looking.
