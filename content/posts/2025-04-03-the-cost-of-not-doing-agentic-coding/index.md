Don't ask yourself _'Why are my high performing engineers spending $2k/month on agentic coding?'_

...ask yourself _why others aren't_.

## Historical Context and Long-Tail Innovation

What we're witnessing with agentic software development is paralleled only by the largest of productivity revolutions throughout history.

When the power loom increased textile production capacity by 40x, it didn't eliminate weaving jobs instead, it unlocked previously unimaginable scale and capacity.

Similarly, when semiconductor manufacturing productivity increased 38x between 1970-2000, it created entirely new product categories rather than simply making existing electronics more efficiently.

What makes agentic coding particularly transformative is its ability to fundamentally reshape how engineers approach problem-solving. Unlike traditional automation that simply speeds up existing processes, agentic coding creates a multiplicative effect by:

- **Eliminating cognitive bottlenecks** - Engineers can offload repetitive implementation details while focusing on higher-level architecture and design choices
- **Compressing knowledge acquisition cycles** - Where learning a new framework or API might have taken days or weeks, engineers can now leverage domain expertise across multiple technical areas simultaneously
- **Enabling parallel exploration of solution spaces** - Multiple approaches can be developed and evaluated concurrently rather than sequentially
- **Reducing the activation energy for creativity** - The cost of experimentation drops dramatically, allowing for more innovative approaches that would otherwise be too resource-intensive to attempt

This combinatorial effect creates a self-reinforcing productivity flywheel. As engineers spend less time on implementation details and more time on strategic thinking, the quality of their architectural decisions improves. These better foundations then amplify the effectiveness of agentic coding assistance, creating a virtuous cycle that compounds over time.

The most profound impact isn't merely coding faster—it's the fundamental shift in what becomes economically viable to build. Projects that were previously deemed too complex, time-consuming, or specialised are now within reach, expanding the frontier of what's possible in software development.

## Analysing the Economics of Agentic Development

For arguments sake, let's say an engineer that _heavily_ utilises AI for large amounts of agentic coding could spend up to $2,000 a month on AI inference.

At first glance, this may seem like a significant investment. However, when we consider the productivity gains that agentic coding unlocks, the economics of this decision become much more compelling.

> [!TIP] TLDR
> Even if enabling agentic coding cost $2,000 per month (which it doesn't), the economics are unmistakable.
>
> With productivity gains of 300-1,000%, **the return on investment is _exceptional_**.

This analysis explores the return on investment in the form of AI inference to unlock agentic coding, considering both the quantifiable productivity metrics and the qualitative improvements in risk profiles, code quality, and strategic capabilities.

We are not talking about throwing $2,000 away on someone blindly piping all the data into a LLM and expecting it to write software (and thus add value) - we are talking about the (potential) spend on _effectively_ using agentic coding tools (e.g. [Cline](https://cline.bot)), coupled with the best AI models (e.g. Claude Sonnet 3.7 at the time of writing this) and the best agent tooling (e.g. [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for package versioning, documentation etc).

This is not a "throw money at the problem" solution - this is about _unlocking_ the potential of the engineer to be able to do more with less, and to be able to do it faster and better.

> [!INFO] Agentic coding is not (currently) full autopilot
> The importance of the engineer understanding and having the most effective tools cannot be understated.
>
> Agentic coding or any other form of AI assisted coding is not (currently) 'autopilot' - it requires good engineering skills and experience to be effective.

## Breaking Down the Numbers

![cost breakdown](cost-breakdown.jpg)

### The Traditional Approach

Let's say our conventional development process costs approximately $12,000 monthly (representing 1.0 unit of work), this $12,000 delivers, predictably, 1.0 unit of work output.

When fully accounting for loaded developer costs ($75-150/hour), this translates to $600-1,200 per developer day. However, this approach carries many hidden costs:

- **Context switching penalties**: Productivity loss and cognitive load when juggling multiple tasks
- **Knowledge dependencies**: Communicating with and waiting for teammates with specialised skills
- **Slow feedback cycles**: Delays in identifying and resolving issues
- **Sequential work limitations**: Inability to meaningfully progress multiple streams in parallel
- **Opportunity costs**: Lost potential from focusing on limited work streams and limiting human investment in time for creative thinking and ideation

### The Agentic Coding Alternative

By contrast, if you add $2,000 to the human cost to unlock Agentic coding it dramatically changes the output equation:

- **Just 16% increase in direct costs**
- **300%-1,000% productivity increase** _(3.0-10.0 units of work delivered)_
- **ROI of 1,700%-5,900%**
- **Payback period of ~1.3 workdays**

These figures align with real-world observations from development teams integrating agentic coding into their workflow, where engineers report producing 5-10x more code while maintaining or improving quality standards once properly enabled and trained on agentic coding.

And let's not forget - it's only $2,000 extra if they actually use $2,000 worth of AI inference, if they use less - the cost is less but it might be an indicator that they're not using AI to unlock their full potential.

## Benefits Beyond Raw Productivity

The productivity metrics represent only one dimension of impact. Several other significant effects emerge when examining agentic coding integration more thoroughly:

### Economic Assessment

The economics of agentic coding are compelling even when considering upper-bound usage scenarios. The $2,000 monthly figure represents an extreme case—what a power user with constant, intensive AI utilisation might incur—yet even at this upper limit, the investment represents just a 16% increase in direct costs relative to the traditional development approach.

With productivity gains delivering ROI calculations ranging from 1,700% to 5,900% and an estimated payback period of approximately 1.3 workdays, agentic coding presents an exceptional economic opportunity in the development toolchain.

When properly analysed, the typical daily cost proposition becomes even more favourable:

- Developer daily cost (excluding hidden costs): $600-1,200
- AI inference daily cost: $5-25 (for heavy usage)
- For most developers: $2-10 per day (typical usage patterns)

It's worth emphasising that most engineers will fall well below the upper threshold, with monthly AI costs typically ranging from $200-800 depending on usage patterns and specific tasks. The key insight isn't about spending the maximum possible, but rather enabling engineers to leverage these tools without arbitrary limitations that undermine their effectiveness.

The true economic implications extend beyond direct productivity measures and include structural changes to development processes: reduced dependency on specialised knowledge, shortened feedback cycles, and practical parallel exploration of solution alternatives—all of which compound the value proposition far beyond the simple calculation of coding output per dollar spent.

### Calculator

For those interested in running calculations specific to their own development contexts, I've created a parametrised calculator: [Agentic Coding ROI Calculator](https://smcleod.net/tools/agentic_coding_costs/) - Note that this is very much a work in progress and cannot possibly account for all variables in a given project or team.

## Jevons Paradox and Value Distribution

The [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) suggests that as resource utilisation becomes more efficient, total consumption often increases rather than decreases. Applied to software development, historical evidence indicates that a 5x productivity improvement wouldn't reduce demand for development - instead, it would dramatically expand the universe of viable software projects.

![Jevons Paradox](jevons.jpg)

The economic value created through this productivity transformation won't simply disappear—it will redistribute across the ecosystem in complex and interconnected ways:

1. **Engineers**: Engineers gain freedom from repetitive implementation tasks, allowing them to focus on intellectually stimulating work and tackle previously intractable problems—improving both job satisfaction and career development.
2. **Organisations**: Beyond merely completing existing project backlogs faster, organisations can fundamentally reimagine their product development strategies. Projects previously considered too speculative or resource-intensive become viable, enabling more experimental approaches and reducing the opportunity cost of innovation.
3. **End users**: As development capacity expands and costs decrease, software solutions will emerge for increasingly specialised needs. Long-neglected "long tail" problems—too niche to warrant conventional development resources—become economically viable to solve, particularly benefiting underserved markets and use cases.
4. **Market entrants**: The reduced capital requirements and compressed development timelines lower barriers to entry across the technology sector. This democratisation enables more diverse founders to bring solutions to market without requiring extensive initial investment, potentially reshaping competitive dynamics across industries.
5. **Adjacent professionals**: Product managers, designers, domain experts, and other non-engineering stakeholders gain the ability to more directly influence and participate in the development process, as the technical barrier between concept and implementation diminishes.
6. **Society**: The cumulative effect of these changes extends beyond immediate economic benefits. As software solutions proliferate into previously underserved domains, we may see accelerated progress on complex societal challenges where software solutions were previously too costly or complex to implement at scale.

Rather than a zero-sum redistribution, agentic coding has the potential to expand the total value created—a rising tide that creates new opportunities across the entire ecosystem while fundamentally changing who can participate in software creation and what problems become economically viable to solve.

## The Hidden Human Cost of Widget Programming

Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of today's software landscape is its profound misuse of human potential. Globally, talented engineers spend their days building variations of the same widgets - auth systems, API integrations, JS framework migrations and ever-valuable widget implementation - that have been implemented thousands of times before.

When we look beneath the surface of enterprise software development, a sobering reality emerges: much of this work isn't advancing innovation or addressing meaningful challenges, but simply recreating slightly modified versions of existing solutions.

This represents an extraordinary waste of human intelligence and creativity. As we continue to advance AI capabilities in software development, the true opportunity isn't merely efficiency - it's the redirection of human cognitive capacity toward genuinely novel problems that demand creativity, ethical judgment, and domain expertise.

The real cost of our current paradigm isn't measured in dollars, but in squandered human potential that could be addressing the vast landscape of unsolved challenges still awaiting our attention.

## Conclusion

The economic case for investing in AI-powered development isn't merely compelling—it's transformative. When 3-10x productivity gains can be achieved with only modest increases in cost, we're no longer discussing incremental improvements but a fundamental shift in what's possible.

This isn't just about coding faster—it's about reimagining how value is created through software. For leadership, this represents a strategic inflection point that demands attention: the organisations that systematically leverage these capabilities will operate in an entirely different economic paradigm from those that don't.

The question isn't whether to adopt these tools, but how quickly you can integrate them to remain competitive. The benefits extend beyond immediate productivity metrics to encompass risk reduction, solution quality, and—perhaps most importantly—the liberation of human potential from repetitive implementation tasks.

As we stand at this crossroads in software development, the cost-benefit analysis couldn't be clearer. The most expensive AI tools are those left unused by your team, as competitors race ahead with fundamentally different economics.
