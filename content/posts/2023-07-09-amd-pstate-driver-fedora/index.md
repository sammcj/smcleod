Recently, after replacing my home server I noticed that the CPU (Ryzen 7600) was only scaling between 3000MHz and 3800MHz, which is the base and the first level boost clock of the CPU. I was expecting it to scale down to as low as 400Mhz when idle, and up to 5.17Ghz on boost.

## Investigation

```plain
cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 3.00 GHz - 5.17 GHz
  available frequency steps:  3.80 GHz, 3.00 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 3.00 GHz and 3.80 GHz.
                  The governor "ondemand" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: 3.00 GHz (asserted by call to hardware)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
    Boost States: 0
    Total States: 2
    Pstate-P0:  3800MHz
    Pstate-P1:  3000MHz
```

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver
acpi-cpufreq

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuinfo_min_freq
3000000

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuinfo_max_freq
3800000
```

```bash
zenstates.py -l
P0 - Enabled - FID = 98 - DID = 8 - VID = C9 - Ratio = 38.00 - vCore = 0.29375
P1 - Enabled - FID = 78 - DID = 8 - VID = 79 - Ratio = 30.00 - vCore = 0.79375
P2 - Disabled
P3 - Disabled
P4 - Disabled
P5 - Disabled
P6 - Disabled
P7 - Disabled
C6 State - Package - Enabled
C6 State - Core - Enabled
```

After a significant amount of reading and hunting through BIOS settings only to find that ASRock have removed the CPPC enablement setting.

I found that while the new AMD P-State driver was merged into the kernel - it didn't seem to load by default with kernel 6.3.11 which is the latest version in the Fedora 38 repositories.

Fedora is currently testing 6.4 and has test packages available, so I decided to give it a go - and it works perfectly.

## Installing the new kernel

The kernel itself is stable, but it's classed as a test package, so you'll need to enable the testing repository.

```bash
dnf install koji -y
koji list-builds --package=kernel --after="2023-07-07" --pattern "kernel-6.4*"
mkdir -p kernel_test && cd kernel_test
koji download-build --arch=x86_64 kernel-6.4.2-201.fc38
dnf update kernel-*.rpm
```

## Enable the driver

There's one more step before rebooting, we need to enable the new AMD P-State driver.

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub`, adding `amd_pstate=enable` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line.
2. Update the bootloader `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg; dracut -f`
3. Reboot

## Check it's working

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver
amd-pstate-epp

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuinfo_min_freq
400000

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuinfo_max_freq
5170000
```

That's the new pstate driver running and 400Mhz to 5.17Ghz!

And if we look at htop, we can see that individual CPU cores are scaling down to 400Mhz when idle:

```plain
    0[       0.0%  400MHz N/A ]   6[          0.0%  400MHz N/A] Tasks: 193, 773 thr, 250 kthr; 1 running
    1[       0.0% 3672MHz 40Â°C]   7[          0.0%  400MHz N/A] Systemd: running (0/739 failed) (0/411 jobs)

    4[       0.0%  400MHz N/A ]  10[|         0.7% 3527MHz N/A] Disk IO: 0.0% read: 0KiB/s write: 0KiB/s
    5[       0.0%  400MHz N/A ]  11[||        1.3%  400MHz N/A] Network: rx: 2KiB/s tx: 1KiB/s (12/5 pkts/s)
  Mem[|||||||||||||||                                                         2.73G/65G] Uptime: 00:16:32
```

There's still something weird up with the hardware pstates which I suspect is something to do with the CPPC mode (action/passive etc...), but it doesn't seem to matter as the frequency scaling is working as expected.

```plain
cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 8:
  driver: amd-pstate-epp
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 8
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 8
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 400 MHz - 5.17 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 400 MHz and 5.17 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 3.34 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
    Boost States: 0
    Total States: 2
    Pstate-P0:  3800MHz
    Pstate-P1:  3000MHz
```

I'm not sure if that's a bug in the driver or the tool, but it doesn't seem to matter ðŸ¤·.

## Conclusion

Great success!
