title: Return Of The RSS
---

Of all the tools for reading news and subscribing to software releases, I still find RSS the most useful.

I use Feedly to manage my rss subscriptions and keep all my devices in sync, but instead of using the Feedly's own client, I use an app called Reeder as the client / reader itself.

## [Feedly](https://feedly.com)

RSS feed subscription management

Features:

- Keyword alerts.
- Browser plugins to subscribe to (current) url.
- Notation and highlighting support (a bit like Evernote).
- Search and filtering across large numbers of feeds / content.
- IFTTT, Zapier, Buffer and Hootsuite integration.
- Built in save / share functionality (that I only use when I'm on the website).
- Backup feeds to Dropbox.
- Very fast, regardless of the fact that I'm in Australia - which often impacts the performance of apps / sites that tend to be hosted on AWS in the US as the latency is so high.
- Article de-duplication is currently being developed I believe, so I'm looking forward to that!
- Easy manual import, export and backup (no vendor lock-in is important to me).
- Public sharing of your Feedly feeds (we're getting very meta here!).

## [Reeder](http://reederapp.com)

A (really) beautiful and fast iOS / macOS client

- The client apps aren't cheap but damn they're good quality, I much prefer them over the standard Feedly apps.
- Obviously supports Feedly as a backend but there are many other source services you can use along side each other.
- I save articles using Reeder's clip to Evernote functionality... a lot.
- Sensible default keyboard shortcuts (or at least for me they felt natural YMMV of course).
- Good customisable 'share with' options.
- Simple, well designed UX.
- Easy manual import an export just like Feedly.
