I spend a lot of time working with AI tools and often get asked for recommendations.

Here is a list of some of the more notable tools I've tried and rated them based on my experience. Hover over the heatmap to see the ratings and any notes as I add them.

I plan on keeping this updated as I try new tools _(we'll see how that goes)_.

More coming soon!
