I spend a lot of time working with AI tools and often get asked for recommendations.

The following is a list of some of the more notable tools I've tried and rated them based on my experience.
Just because something has a low rating doesn't mean it's bad - it just means it didn't work well for me and I wouldn't personally recommend it.

I plan on keeping this updated as I try new tools _(we'll see how that goes)_.
