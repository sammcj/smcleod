TLDR; Maybe.

Longer answer:

Capitalism sucks, hard.

It's the bad card we've been dealt, for-profit companies will always be looking to reduce costs and increase profits. If this means they can reduce expenses by automating an activity - they will (eventually).

To look at this another way - if the output of your job is repeatable and not creative - one could argue that (other than providing you income), it might also not be the best use of your time.

For-profit companies will continue to focus on profits over people, governments will continue to be slow to act and life will be very hard for many people not in a position to adapt - made worse back the lack of universal basic income or similar.

If I was ruthless capitalist tycoon - I would say something like "evolution isn't mandatory, but neither is survival", but I'm not, and that's not helpful to humanity.

In reality while there's a lot of nuance to this discussion, I think it's of the upmost importance to focus efforts on awareness, cross-skilling, re-skilling both yourself and those around you, to push for a more equitable society where the benefits of automation are shared by all (it's good to have dreams, right?) because like it or not - things are changing, and they're changing fast.

Work won't go away. The work we value will change. New work will be created and employers will _(eventually)_ adapt - but it's unlikely to meet the pace of change.

Until such time as the world is no longer built on the backs of working to make the rich richer, It's not AI itself you have to fear, but the companies that place profits over people and for those that are not in a position to adapt.
