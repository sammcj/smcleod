# About Me

![](/profilephoto/apple-touch-icon.png)

> Hi I'm Sam 👋🏻

I'm a [1x Engineer](https://1x.engineer/) in the Platform/Automation/DevOps space.

Currently working as a [Platform Engineering Lead](/cv/) at [DigIO](htttps://digio.com.au) in Melbourne, Australia.

This site is my tech blog, a place to share my thoughts and ideas (mainly relating to engineering), and a place to keep track of things I've learned.
