# About Me

![](/profilephoto/apple-touch-icon.png)

> Hi I'm Sam 👋🏻

I'm a principal AI & platform engineer, open source advocate and contributor.

I've been in tech for 20~ years across platform, software, AI in technical leadership roles. The past 5 years I've been heavily focused on LLM and AI technologies.

Currently working with [Mantel Group](https://mantelgroup.com.au) (Melbourne, Australia) leading enablement and acceleration of software engineering with AI.

> [!INFORMATION] 🎉 Remote Work
>
> I made it a career goal to be 100% remote which came to fruition through covid - and I will never go back to working from an office.
>
> The gains to my health, happiness and productivity have been immense and my position is that any employer that doesn't recognise and value this is not an employer I want to work for.

This site is my tech blog, a place to share my thoughts and ideas (mainly relating to engineering), and a place to keep track of things I've learned.
