title: SSD Storage Cluster - Update and Diagram
---

Due to several recent events beyond my control I'm a bit behind on the project - hence the lack of updates which I apologise for.

The goods news is that I'm back working to finish off the clusters and I'm happy to report that all is going to plan.

This was generated from the [LCMC](http://github.com/rasto/lcmc) tool (beware - it's java!).

More on this soon...
